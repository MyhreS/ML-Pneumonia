# ML-Pneumonia
 
This is a group assignment for the Master's course "Machine Learning" at Ã˜stfold University College. 
The assignment is to create a neural network on a dataset of our choice. We chose the dataset from 
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia. This dataset contains 
chest x-ray images of patients with and without pneumonia. We will use this dataset to create a
neural network that can classify if a patient has pneumonia or not.

## Group
The group consists of:
Simon Myhre,
Fathima Jubina Pathari,
and Md Mohaiminul Islam Emon

## Contents
The repository contains the code for the visualisation of the dataset, the code for augmenting the dataset
and the code for the neural network.
